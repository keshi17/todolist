Introducing "Keshikaâ€™s Tasks for Today" â€” a simple and colorful To-Do List app created using Python and Tkinter! ðŸŒŸ Whether it's noting down your daily goals, tracking habits, or just organizing your thoughts, this app is designed to make your everyday planning feel easy and fun. With a clean interface, responsive buttons, and a satisfying task-complete feature, it's more than just a list â€” it's a little productivity boost wrapped in creativity. From workouts to water breaks, everything stays on track! Built with passion, a pinch of Python, and a splash of color, this app is my way of blending code with daily life
Built with Python + Tkinter: I used Python as the core language and Tkinter to design the graphical interface. Tkinter helped me create the layout, buttons, entry fields, and list box to display and manage tasks. Each button is linked to a function â€” for adding, removing, or completing tasks â€” making the app interactive and user-friendly. With simple yet effective GUI elements, Python and Tkinter together brought this colorful task manager to life!
